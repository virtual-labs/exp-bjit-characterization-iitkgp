## Aim of experiment
<li>Exponential Behavior: In the active region, both I<sub>b</sub> and I<sub>c</sub> exhibit an exponential increase with V<sub>be</sub> , confirming the expected theoretical behavior.</li>
<li>Parameter Extraction: From the slopes of the linear portions of the log-scale plots, parameters such as the saturation current I<sub>s</sub> and the current gain ùõΩ can be extracted.</li>
<li>Deviation Analysis: Any deviation from the expected exponential behavior at high V<sub>be</sub> might indicate high injection effects or parasitic resistances.</li>
