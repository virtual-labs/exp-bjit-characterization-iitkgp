## Aim of experiment
<li>Exponential Behavior: In the active region, both I_b and I_c exhibit an exponential increase with V_be , confirming the expected theoretical behavior.</li>
<li>Parameter Extraction: From the slopes of the linear portions of the log-scale plots, parameters such as the saturation current I_s and the current gain ùõΩ can be extracted.</li>
<li>Deviation Analysis: Any deviation from the expected exponential behavior at high V_be might indicate high injection effects or parasitic resistances.</li>
